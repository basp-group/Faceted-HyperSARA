ncores = 36
memory = unlimited

MATLAB settings have been changed.  These settings persist between MATLAB sessions.
Maximum number of computational threads (maxNumCompThreads)          = 36
Preferred number of workers in a parallel pool (PreferredNumWorkers) = 36
MATLAB default cluster profile is 'local'
MATLAB 'local' cluster profile settings:
Number of workers to start on your local machine (NumWorkers)        = 36
Number of computational threads to use on each worker (NumThreads)   = 1

NumWorkers and NumThreads can be changed (using parcluster and saveProfile)
but NumWorkers * NumThreads should be less than 36
