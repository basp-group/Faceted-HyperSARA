 function p = prox_squared_bathtub(x, gamma, w)
%function p = prox_squared_bathtub(x, gamma, w)
%
% This procedure computes the proximity operator of the function:
%
%               f(x) = gamma/2 * max{|x|-w,0}^2     with w > 0
%
% When the input 'x' is an array, the output 'p' is computed element-wise.
%
%  INPUTS
% ========
%  x     - ND array
%  gamma - positive, scalar or ND array with the same size as 'x'
%  w     - positive, scalar or ND array with the same size as 'x'
