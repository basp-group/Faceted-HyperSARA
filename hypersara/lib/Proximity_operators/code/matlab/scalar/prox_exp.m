 function p = prox_exp(x, gamma)
%function p = prox_exp(x, gamma)
%
% This procedure computes the proximity operator of the function:
%
%                    f(x) = gamma * exp(x)
%
% When the input 'x' is an array, the output 'p' is computed element-wise.
%
%  INPUTS
% ========
%  x     - ND array
%  gamma - positive, scalar or ND array with the same size as 'x'
% 
%  DEPENDENCIES
% ==============
%  Lambert_W.m - located in the folder 'utils'
