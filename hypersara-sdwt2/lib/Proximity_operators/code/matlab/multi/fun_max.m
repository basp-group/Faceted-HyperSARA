 function p = fun_max(x, gamma, dir)
%function p = fun_max(x, gamma, dir)
%
% This procedure evaluates the function:
%
%                   f(x) = gamma * max(x)
%
% When the input 'x' is an array, the computation can vary as follows:
%  - dir = 0 --> 'x' is processed as a single vector [DEFAULT]
%  - dir > 0 --> 'x' is processed block-wise along the specified direction
%
%  INPUTS
% ========
%  x     - ND array
%  gamma - positive, scalar or ND array compatible with the blocks of 'x'
%  dir   - integer, direction of block-wise processing
