 function p = fun_logit(x, gamma)
%function p = fun_logit(x, gamma)
%
% This procedure evaluates the function:
%
%            f(x) = gamma * log( 1 + exp(x) )
%
% When the input 'x' is an array, the output 'p' is the element-wise sum.
%
%  INPUTS
% ========
%  x     - ND array
%  gamma - positive, scalar or ND array with the same size as 'x'
